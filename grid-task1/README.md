# Bootstrap 5 - Grid System Practice (Task 1)

## Project Description

This is a simple HTML project built to practice and demonstrate the core concepts of the Bootstrap 5 grid system. It was created as part of my self-learning path for MERN Full Stack Development.

As I noted while building it: "I learned and practiced some bootstrap basic concepts. In this project, I implemented bootstrap grid system and added background color, text color. It's easy to use when responsive design comes."

## Key Bootstrap Concepts Used

* **Grid System:** `container-fluid`, `row`, `col-*`
* **Nested Grid:** A `row` is nested inside a `col-12` to demonstrate more complex layouts.
* **Utility Classes:**
    * **Colors:** `bg-dark`, `bg-primary`, `bg-success`, `bg-info`, `text-white`
    * **Spacing:** `p-5`
    * **Flexbox:** `d-flex`, `justify-content-center`, `align-items-center` for vertical and horizontal centering.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* Bootstrap 5.3.3
